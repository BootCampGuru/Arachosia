            At ARACHOSIA GRILL, we prepare freshly made dishes infused with natural ingredients and Afghan authenticity. After all, healthy and savory food feeds the body and the soul.

            When life gives us lemons, we don’t just make lemonade. We make awesome salads, a yummy garlic mint sauce, a freshly blended hummus, a mouthwatering chicken marinade, and well, almost every other item on our menu too! We know that what you eat defines you, and we like to define ourselves as Afghan gourmets with a strong appetite for life but without leaving a hole in your pockets.

            In case you are still wondering, Arachosia, pronounced as ARA-KHO-ZIA, is the ancient name for Kandahar, a city located in southern Afghanistan.
